##Description

Let's Ride connects cyclists to other biking enthusiasts in their area.  Find interesting publically available rides in your area to join and meet new friends.  Manage private rides with invited friends only.  Manage your routes, past and upcoming rides.

##Wireframes
We lost our hard copies of the wireframes after they were put into production

##User Stories
- Johnny is new to the area and wants to meet fellow cyclists to ride with.  He goes to Let's Ride to search for upcoming rides in his area.  He searches based on location and skill level/average speed.
- Isom has a bunch of cycling buddies and he wants a better way to plan a ride with them.  He uses Let's Ride to create a ride and invite his friends to come with him.  He sets the route with google maps API, average speed, description of ride, estimated time, time and location of departure, and location of finish.
- Mike wants to plan a ride but he doesnt want to do it. He creates a ride on Let's Ride and opens it up to the public so anyone can join.
- Jimmy wants to plan an overnight cycling/camping trip with his friends, but he also wants to open it up to anyone so that he can make some new friends with a shared interest.  Jimmy creates the event on Let's Ride and sets it to public. He emails the link to his friends so they can join, too.
